Analysis of Airbnb Boston dataset

Trying to find what to do and what not to do as someone who wants to gain profit from Airbnb in Boston:
1) Installations:
   
   Jupyter notebook: https://jupyter.org/install

   Python libraries:
   Pandas,
   Numpy,
   Matplotlib,
   Seaborn,
   OS,
   Sklearn,
   Scipy,
   ast.

2) Project motivations:

   I have done this analysis to satisfy a requirement for the Data Scientist Nanodegree offered by Udacity, it was an interesting journey where I learned a lot about Airbnb.

3) File Descriptions:

   Airbnb_Boston.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook where all the analyses were done.

   CSV files.zip: a zip file that contains three CSV files: the cleaned reviews data set, a file that contains a list of positive adjectives, and a file that contains a list of negative adjectives

4) The best way to use this project is by running the whole notebook except the part where the cleaning of the reviews data set is happening as I have already done this part, each trial is separated so you can run totally by itself (you can do that if you at least fully run the notebook for one time)
